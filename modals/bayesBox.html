The appearance of this panel indicates that the minimum data needed to calculate a Bayes factor is in place. You can display its value by clicking on <span style='color:#3a4e69;font-weight:900;'><i class='fa-solid fa-calculator fa-fw'></i>Calculate</span>, and use the scale below to get some qualitative intuition of the evidence in favor of pathogenicity for the variant. If all goes well, a <span style='color:#3a4e69;font-weight:900;'><i class='fa-solid fa-rocket fa-fw'></i>Sensitivity</span> button will also appear on the right, and you may click on it to perform some additional analyses.<br>

The FLB calculation may sometimes fail. The main reasons can be numerical problems in the computation of the final penetrances, Mendelian errors in the pedigree (not currently supported by this software) or other inconsistencies between penetrance and pedigree (e.g. two unaffected parents cannot have an affected child under a simple full penetrance model). If you cannot figure out the cause, please get in touch!<br>
