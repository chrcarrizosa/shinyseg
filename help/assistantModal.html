<p>This panel assists in optimizing your <code>Relative risk</code>
model parameters based on cumulative incidence data. Simply specify
pairs of age (integer between 1-100) and their corresponding cumulative
incidence using the table. Note that you can remove the default values
and add/remove rows to make adjustments as needed. In addition, the
<span style="color:#4e4e4e;"><i class="fa-solid fa-ruler fa-fw"></i>Length</span>
slider allows you to fine-tune the modelâ€™s complexity by setting the
number of values for the hazard ratio vector.</p>
<p>The plot presents the entered values (dots) and the cumulative
incidences fitted by the optimal parameters (lines). The values of these
parameters are also displayed below the table, and you may easily
transfer them to your analysis by using the dropdown below the plot.</p>
