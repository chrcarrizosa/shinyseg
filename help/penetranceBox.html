<p><strong>The inheritance pattern</strong></p>
<p>Choose the inheritance pattern using the buttons on the right of the
header:</p>
<div style="display:flex;">
<div>
<ul>
<li><code>AD</code>: autosomal dominant.</li>
<li><code>AR</code>: autosomal recessive.</li>
<li><code>AI</code>: autosomal incomplete dominance.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><code>XD</code>: X-linked dominant.</li>
<li><code>XR</code>: X-linked recessive.</li>
<li><code>XI</code>: X-linked incomplete dominance.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>Note that incomplete dominance, where you can specify different
parameters for the carriers 1 and 2 copies of the variant, will be
unavailable unless you also switch to the <code>Liability class</code>
mode.</p>

<p><strong>Specifying the penetrances</strong></p>
<p>shinyseg offers two different ways for specifying the penetrances, or
probabilities of disease onset conditional on carriership status.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Relative risk</code>, where the penetrances are computed by
the app based on certain parameters.</li>
<li><code>Liability class</code>, where the user manually specifies the
penetrances.</li>
</ul>
<p>The modes can be switched using the input on the left of the
header.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Mode: Relative risk</strong></p>
<p>A parametric version of the survival penetrances introduced by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41436-020-0920-4">Belman et
al. (2020)</a>. It is based on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Baseline lifetime risk, mean and SD:</strong> the lifetime
risk, mean, and standard deviation of disease onset in non-carriers and
heterozygous carriers in recessive inheritance.</li>
<li><strong>Hazard ratios:</strong> the relative risks in homo-, hemi-,
and heterozygous carriers in dominant inheritance, compared to the
baseline. They can be either constant or age-dependent and may also be
specified through a <strong>variant-associated lifetime
risk</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These parameters are entered using a table generated from the
phenotypes specified in the pedigree table. For example, the following
describes a constant relative risk model in which non-carriers have a
lifetime risk of <code>affected</code> of 1% (phenocopy rate) with onset
at 70±15 years of age, while heterozygous and homozygous carriers have a
lifetime risk of 75%.</p>
<pre><code>                   neg             het/hom                    
  sex  phenotype  risk  mean  SD      risk     hazard ratio(s)
 both   affected  0.01    70  15      0.75              137.93</code></pre>
<p>*By default, shinyseg generates two entries for each phenotype to
allow for sex-specific penetrances. Changing either sex to
<code>both</code> applies its parameters to both sexes. To return to
sex-dependent specification, select one of the sexes again.</p>
<p>In the previous example, the hazard ratios were represented by a
single value, indicating a constant (age-independent) relative risk.
Additionally, this was automatically updated based on the other
parameters. However, this column can also be directly manipulated and
used to specify models where relative risks are age-dependent. To do
this, enter up to 10 comma-separated values representing, loosely
speaking, the hazard ratios at evenly spaced ages from 1 to 100 years.
For instance, <code>1,10,10,20,10</code> would correspond to the ratios
at ages 1, 25, 50, 75 and 100 (approximately). The app will
interpolate/smooth these across the lifespan using a B-spline basis on
the log scale — you may adjust the degree of smoothing with <span style="color:#4e4e4e;"><i class="fa-solid fa-wave-square fa-fw"></i>Splines</span>.</p>
<p>Note that it is also possible to leverage the variant-associated
lifetime risk, as earlier, but combined with a vectorial specification
of the hazard ratios. For instance, changing the hazard ratio(s) to
<code>1,2,2,1</code> defines a model where the relative risk is higher
at middle ages. Subsequently, resetting the lifetime risk to 75% will
scale these values accordingly, resulting in:</p>
<pre><code>                   neg             het/hom                         
  sex  phenotype  risk  mean  SD      risk          hazard ratio(s)
 both   affected  0.01    70  15      0.75     1, 305.02, 305.02, 1</code></pre>
<p>As choosing these parameters can be challenging, shinyseg offers an
<span style="color:#4e4e4e;"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info fa-fw"></i>Assistant</span>
to optimize them based on user-provided cumulative incidence data.
Additionally, the <span style="color:#4e4e4e;"><i class="fa-solid fa-chart-line fa-fw"></i>Plot</span>
serves as a visual guide, displaying the cumulative incidences, hazard
rates, or hazard ratios determined by the current selection.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i class="fa fa-triangle-exclamation fa-fw" style="color:#db1f48"></i>
None of the model parameters can be missing. If you misspecify the
hazard ratio(s), their values will revert to the previous ones to
prevent issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br> <br></p>
<p><strong>Mode: Liability class</strong></p>
<p>Alternatively, users can manually define penetrances using a table.
This table contains 2 (dominant/recessive) to 3 (incomplete inheritance)
columns with the penetrances themselves, followed by an additional 3
columns specifying the classes they apply to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>sex:</strong> <code>male</code>, <code>female</code>, or
<code>both</code> for classes referring to males, females, or both
sexes, respectively; leaving this cell empty is equivalent to specifying
<code>both</code>.</li>
<li><strong>phenotype:</strong> a free-text field whose values should
match the phenotypes in the pedigree table. Note that here,
<code>nonaff</code> is treated as another phenotype whose classes must
be specified (unless there are no unaffected cases); leaving this cell
empty indicates that the class applies to all phenotypes.</li>
<li><strong>ages:</strong> an integer from 1 to 100 or ranges between
these values (e.g., 10-20, 30-100…) indicating the ages to which the
class applies; leaving this cell empty is equivalent to specifying ages
1-100.</li>
</ul>
<p>For instance, the following illustrates an autosomal dominant model
with no phenocopies, where both heterozygous and homozygous carriers
have a 100% chance of disease onset:</p>
<pre><code>  neg   het/hom                       
 risk      risk   sex  phenotype  ages
 0.00      1.00                       </code></pre>
<p>And the following defines a sex- and age-dependent specification with
incomplete dominance:</p>
<pre><code>  neg   het   hom                             
 risk  risk  risk      sex   phenotype    ages
 0.00  0.20  0.40     male                1-50
 0.00  0.20  0.40   female                1-50
 0.05  0.40  0.70     male              51-100
 0.20  0.40  0.90   female              51-100</code></pre>
<p>The table may be created interactively or by uploading a file via
<span style="color:#4e4e4e;"><i class="fa-solid fa-file-import fa-fw"></i>Load
file</span>. If opting for the latter, shinyseg expects a tabular file
without column headers and a structure resembling the one shown
in-app.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i class="fa fa-triangle-exclamation fa-fw" style="color:#db1f48"></i>
There should be no sex/phenotype/age overlaps. All family members in the
pedigree table should map to a single liability class without missing
penetrances.</p>
</blockquote>
