# How toâ€¦ {#how-to}

Here you can find all the details on how to run your analyses with
shinyseg. The analysis workflow consists on mainly three steps organized
in sequential modules:

``` mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```

The app is designed to provide a guided experience, in the sense that
you will not be able to move forward if there is some critical
information missing, or wrongly specified. You will be informed of such
cases via the notification menu on the upper right corner.

Note that you can save your progress at any time by clicking on **Save
report**. The resulting HTML file can be opened with a web browser, but
also loaded back into shinyseg to resume the analysis using **Load
report**.
